Repio, also known as The Master of Code, spends his days bending time and space just to fix a broken function while simultaneously trying to figure out how to feed his plants without overwatering them (it's a real struggle). By day, he’s a game developer who pretends to be serious. By night, he’s the secret mastermind behind a project where you play as a giant potato in a post-apocalyptic world where avocados have taken over.

His devlogs are legendary—rumor has it, even the Minecraft YouTubers are shaking in their boots because of how epic (and chaotic) his “Made With” series is. It's basically like watching an explosion in a comedy show, only with more math and broken keyboards.

When Repio isn’t unleashing code that might end up summoning a new form of life (still unconfirmed), he’s out there trying to make sense of the fact that his coffee machine refuses to be "innovative enough." Some call it a meltdown, others call it a visionary moment. Either way, there's probably a GIF of it on Twitter.

Other fun facts about Repio:

Tried to program a character with an existential crisis… and ended up with a dog who barks at the concept of fate.
Once, his code crashed the internet. It wasn’t intentional, but he totally took credit for it.
His hobbies include arguing with his shoes about whether they should be more supportive in life and creating chaos for fun because WHY NOT?
One day, he plans to release a game about a chicken who’s convinced it’s a dragon, but for now, he’s just trying to figure out how to make a spaghetti-eating NPC perform a backflip without breaking physics.
